      key [id]. On success, [tmpdir] is saved as [id], which can be used
      as the [base] for further builds, until it is expired from the cache.
      On failure, nothing is recorded and calling [build] again will make
      another attempt at building it.
      The builder will not request concurrent builds for the same [id] (it
      will handle that itself). It will also not ask for a build that already
      exists (i.e. for which [result] returns a path).

      must be called to free it when done.
      If the cache [name] does not exist, it is first created (as an empty directory,
      and owned by [user]).
      When the copy is released, it is snapshotted to become the new latest
      version of the cache, unless the cache has already been updated since
      it was snapshotted, in which case this writeable copy is simply discarded. *)

      the delete might fail because an item got a new child during the delete, or
      we might delete something that the build is using.
