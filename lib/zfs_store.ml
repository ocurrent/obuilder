(* This is rather complicated, because (unlike btrfs):
   - zfs won't let you delete datasets that other datasets are cloned from.
     However, you can "promote" a dataset, so that it switches roles with its parent.
   - Some zfs commands use "--" to separate options from arguments, but others interpret it as an argument!
   - Sometimes we need "datasets" and at other times we need pathnames (the difference is a leading '/')

   Example of zfs promotion:

   1. Create ds1.
   2. Create snapshots ds1@snap1, ds1@snap2, ds1@snap3.
   3. Create clones of ds1@snap2: clone1, clone2, clone3.

   At this point:
   - ds1 has clones {clone1, clone2, clone3} and snapshots {snap1, snap2, snap3}.

   4. Promote clone2.

   Now:
   - clone2 has clones {clone1, ds1, clone3} and snapshots {snap1, snap2}.
   - ds1 has no clones and snapshots {snap3}.

   - Either we have a dataset with the latest snapshot of the cache

     snapshot immediately).

   - Any other tags on main are marked for deletion, but some clones
     still depend on them. They will all be older than "snap".

   - There may be clones of main. These clones have no snapshots, and no
     further sub-clones.

   We clone main@snap, and then let the user write to that (tmp) with the lock
   released.

   When the user releases tmp, we retake the lock and then either:

   - Destroy tmp, or
   - Replace main with tmp (see comments in code).

   Crash recovery:

   - We might crash before making the main@snap tag. If main is missing this tag,
     it is safe to create it, since we must have been just about to do that.
